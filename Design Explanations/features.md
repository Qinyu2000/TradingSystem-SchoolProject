#List of Features we implemented
1. All mandatory features
 a. (the "new type of account" is involved in the Tutorial).
 b. The additional status is Inactive
2. Android GUI - based on the enormous amount of code we had to rewrite (none of our controllers or
presenters from Phase 1 were ever used, we had to change our Gateways), we believe this merits at 
least 3 additional features.
3. Home City feature
4. Having "Online Trades"
5. Change Password
6. Ability to view the traders in the system with their information
